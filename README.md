# Simple-GPT-chat-bot-telegram
Very simple python code that created a telegram bot with GPT chat

The bot was created for those who want to understand this topic themselves and do not want to download already perfectly made bots. Good luck to all

Instruction:
1. For the bot to work, you must first download the libraries: python-telegram-bot (pip install python-telegram-bot), openai (pip install openai)

2. After installing the libraries, you will need to get two tokens. From telegram and from openai:

telegram: In the telegram, look for the @BotFather bot and create a token.

openai: We will need to create an account and create a token

3. After receiving the tokens, you need to insert the telegram token into the telegram_token field, and the openai token into the openai.api_key field.

4. Then we test and improve.

Libraries used: python-telegram-bot, openai

Programming language: Python
